# Data Science Documentation

## What is Data Science?
- Understanding the inbuilt pattern, inbuilt logics, inbuilt analytics about the data for future use is called **Data Science**.
- Detailed study of data is called **Data Science**.
- It is the process of letting our system, model, or laptop understand data on its own.
- Letting our machine understand the data on its own by training the model (program).
- **Machine Learning** is the process or mechanism that reads the data and gets itself trained on it.

> **Important Point:**  
> Data Science is nothing but Machine Learning which can be written in **Python**.

## Data Types

1. **Structured Data** (JSON, EXCEL, CSV, DB)
2. **Unstructured Data** (Images, Audio, Video)
3. **Semi-Structured Data** (Text File)

- **Machine Learning** works with **Structured Data** (CSV).
- **Deep Learning** works with **Unstructured Data** (Images, Audio, Video, etc.).

## Data Analytics vs Data Science

### Step 1: Data Preparation

1. **Collection of Data** (CSV)
2. **Data Preprocessing**
    - **Data Cleaning**
        - Removing null values
        - Removing duplicates
    - **Data Wrangling**
        - Converting categorical data into numerical data
    - **Feature Engineering** (Input X or independent data)
        - Feature Scaling (Data Transformation)
        - Feature Selection
    - **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**

---

### Step 2:

#### For Data Analysis:
- After preprocessing, the data is used for various activities in **Excel** or **PowerBI**.

#### For Data Science:
- After preprocessing, certain algorithms are used for **prediction**.

## Algorithms (Pre-defined Functions)

### 1.1 Supervised Algorithms *(When we work by knowing the target)*

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- KNN (K Nearest Neighbor)

### 1.2 Unsupervised Algorithms *(When we work without knowing the target)*

- Clustering (K-Means)
- t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- DBSCAN
- Hierarchical Clustering

### 1.3 Semi-Supervised Algorithms

---

### Step 3: Model Optimization

- Hyperparameter Tuning and Optimization
- Model Evaluation and Metrics

---

### Step 4: Model Output

- Model Output Visualization
- Model Deployment

## Tools Not Directly Related to Data Science

1. **GitHub** (Version Control Tool)
2. **SQL** (Database)
3. **PowerBI** (Visualization)
4. **Jenkins** (CI/CD Tool)
5. **Deep Learning** and **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**

> **Note:**  
> Machine Learning processes can be done with both **code** and **no-code platforms** (e.g., dataiku).
